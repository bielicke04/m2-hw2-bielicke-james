I found Boostrap interesting – and I can see the interest in it – but I feel, as a designer, I lose some of that "control" when creating the composition. I was struggling a little understanding the overall grid system when overlayed with flexbox. It sort of hurt my head trying to wrap my head around it all, but it could also be the newness of it all. I can see the pro & cons of Bootstrap. I'm not sure how much I'll reply on it in the future. I like going in and tweaking the CSS vs. just having it sor of done for me.
